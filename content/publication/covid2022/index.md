abstract: We study the effect of the anti-contagious policy on labor market outcomes. By exploiting variation in the duration of the zero-Covid policy in China, which is triggered by the outbreak of new cases of Covid-19, we find that a 10% increase (3.7 days in average) in the duration of the zero-Covid policy caused the probability of unemployment to increase by around 0.1. We show that the estimated policy effect is disentangled from the health shock effect. By a back of envelope calculation, we estimate the increase in unemployment probability would decrease by 12 percent if the restriction of lifting the zero-Covid policy was relaxed from a 14-day zero case window to a 5-day restriction. Moreover, the zero-Covid policy decreases the labor income and hours worked for employed individuals, and the policy effect is heterogeneous across demographic groups. We also examined the policy effect during different phases of the pandemic, and the results imply that the stringent containment during the first stage of the pandemic caused the negative impacts on the labor outcomes, while the subsequent precise containment strategy did not generate significant influence on the labor market outcomes.
