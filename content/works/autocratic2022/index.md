abstract: An autocrat equipped with the absolute power dominates over the subordinates, meanwhile a class of aristocrats usually existed in any autocratic regime. This paper considers a principal-agent model with no third-party enforcement. An innovative setting that allows the principal to design the agents’ expected vacancy value explains how granting privilege to the agents could optimize the principal’s expected profit.
